# Unity Pong

### What is it?
This is a re-imagining of the classic arcade game "Pong."
It was made in Unity with the intention of getting some
more practice with the engine.

### How does it work?
The game can be launched by navigating to the `build` directory
and running `Pong.exe`. You'll be greeted by a main menu where
you can select either a 1-Player or 2-Player game. The left paddle
can be controlled with the "W" and "S" keys. The right paddle
can be controlled in a 2-Player game using the Up and Down arrow
keys.

### Why did I make this?
The primary objective here was to get some more practice using the
Unity engine. Pong seemed like an extremely simple game to re-create,
so I chose it to practice things like adding sound effects and menus
to a game, which I've never implemented in Unity before. It also gave
me some practice working with screen-space coordinates in Unity, counter to
working with its usual world-space coordinate system.
